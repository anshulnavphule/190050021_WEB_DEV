			I am a first year student who has been promoted to second year, thanks to Covid-19(or no thanks ig?) at IIT Bombay. I did my high school from Children Senior Secondary School, Kota.
			<br>
			As for my hobbies, they used to be limited to listening to music and gaming, but since I have been home quarantined, I have also developed a newly found interest in TV series.
